This project uses a Random Forest Classifier to predict breast cancer outcomes and applies SHAP analysis to interpret the model's predictions. It provides insights into the key features influencing the classification of malignant or benign tumors.

## Overview
This project aims to predict the presence of breast cancer in patients using machine learning techniques, specifically the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model is trained on a dataset of various features such as tumor characteristics, and its goal is to classify whether the tumor is malignant or benign. Additionally, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis is employed to explain the model's predictions, providing insights into which features contribute the most to the classification decision.

## Project Features
**Data Preprocessing:** The raw data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and features are scaled for optimal model performance.
**Modeling:** A Random Forest Classifier is used to train the model and predict the likelihood of cancer being malignant or benign.
**SHAP Analysis:** SHAP values are calculated to explain the contributions of different features to the model's predictions, making the model more interpretable.
